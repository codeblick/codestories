I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. At home you have unlimited time. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Let all these things just sort of happen. A big strong tree needs big strong roots.

If you hypnotize it, it will go away. We can fix anything. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. A little happy sunlight shining through there.

La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. This is truly an almighty mountain. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look.

I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Don't fiddle with it all day. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there.

You can get away with a lot. Fluff that up. This is your world. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. Imagination is the key to painting.

Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. Son of a gun. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds.
